# Mod of the Year 2025 - Voting Application

A Flask-based voting application for Twitch community "Mod of the Year" contests. Features verified user system with weighted voting for subscribers and VIPs.

## Features

- âœ… Verified user whitelist system (only approved users can vote)
- âœ… Weighted voting: Followers (1 vote), Subs/VIPs (2 votes)
- âœ… Duplicate vote prevention
- âœ… Case-insensitive username matching
- âœ… OBS integration with individual vote count text files
- âœ… Admin panel for monitoring votes
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design with gaming theme

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Verified Users

Create a CSV file with your Twitch community members:

```csv
username,tier
viewer1,follower
viewer2,sub
viewer3,vip
```

Valid tiers: `follower`, `sub`, `vip`

### 3. Populate Database

```bash
python populate_users.py your_users.csv
```

This creates `votes.db` with your verified users.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will run at `http://localhost:5000`

## Testing Locally

Test users are included in `test_users.csv`:

```bash
python populate_users.py test_users.csv
python app.py
```

Test usernames:
- `testfollower1`, `testfollower2` (1 vote each)
- `testsub1`, `testsub2` (2 votes each)
- `testvip1` (2 votes)

Visit `http://localhost:5000` and try voting!
